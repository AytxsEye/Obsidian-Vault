So far: Woke up BBEG, Went to and from #Brittsburg tomb.

At #Brittsburg the party will encounter a well established invading force. They will fight through the main gate and meet several townsfolk still trying to escape. ==Upon helping these people==, the party will be led to a series of tunnels where the remaining townsfolk are hiding. They will then be asked to lead a group to fight back against the invaders. ==If these people are not helped==, the party will clean up the invading force without assistance.

After clearing out #Brittsburg the party is told to head north to #Red-Lake where more invaders are wreaking havoc. The party can either head north, or leave the protected area of the #Stone-Forest .
